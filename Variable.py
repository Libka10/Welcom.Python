 # Here 19 will pop up actually.




 # If you give a variable an illegal name, you get a syntax error. In the example below, each of the variable names is illegal.

# 76trombones = "big parade"
# more$ = 1000000
# class = "Computer Science 101"
# 76trombones is illegal because it does not begin with a letter. 
# more$ is illegal because it contains an illegal character, the dollar sign. But what’s wrong with class?

# It turns out that class is one of the Python keywords. Keywords define the language’s syntax rules and structure,
#  and they cannot be used as variable names. 
# Python has thirty-something keywords (and every now and again improvements to Python introduce or eliminate one or two). 
# This list is current as of Python.
